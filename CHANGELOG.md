# Orchestrator Changelog

## 2026-02-23

### Partner Context Management

- **Context usage meter** — Activity panel shows context % for each active worker
  - Parses Claude session JSONL files to extract token usage
  - Color-coded progress bars (green/yellow/red)
- **Partner history viewer** — New tab showing filtered conversation history
  - Shows user and assistant text messages only (no tool calls/thinking)
  - Auto-refreshes, closable tab with chat icon
- **Partner reset button** — Soft reset to restart the partner session
  - Sends Ctrl-C to interrupt, then restarts claude
- **New API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/workers/usage` — Token usage for all active workers
  - `GET /api/partner/history` — Filtered conversation history
  - `POST /api/partner/reset` — Restart partner session
- **New component:** `PartnerHistory.jsx` — Scrollable message history viewer
- **API version bump:** 0.3.0 → 0.4.0

---

### API Client Cleanup

- **Minor API response handling improvements** — Performance comment in api.js

---

### Push Tab Mounted + Parallel Operations

- **Keep Push tab mounted** — Push tab stays mounted during tab switches to preserve state (checkboxes, progress)
- **Parallelize doc updates and pushes** — Update docs and push operations now run concurrently across projects instead of sequentially

### Push Upstream Detection

- **Fixed push to detect upstream remote/branch** — Push API now queries git for the tracking branch and pushes to correct remote (e.g., `github/master` instead of always `origin/main`)

---

### Push Tab Improvements

- **Push tab close button** — Push tab now closable like file/diff tabs
- **Always commit docs before push** — Removed `commit_docs` flag, API now always stages and commits modified doc files (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, USAGE.md) before pushing
- **Push tab icon** — Blue arrow (⬆) icon for push tabs in TabBar

---

### Push Workflow with Auto Doc Updates

- **PushDialog.jsx** — Modal workflow for pushing changes across projects
  - Step 1: Shows unpushed commits per project, checkbox to update docs
  - Step 2: Runs `claude -p` to update CHANGELOG/TODO/USAGE per project
  - Step 3: Review changes and push all
- **`POST /api/update-docs`** — Spawns Claude to update docs for a project
  - Builds context from: unpushed commits, git diff, worker session logs
  - Runs `claude -p` with allowedTools for Read/Edit/Write/Bash/Glob
  - Returns updated file status
- **`POST /api/push`** — Commits doc updates (if any) and pushes
- **`GET /api/doc-context`** — Returns context for doc automation
  - Includes commit messages, diff stats, worker logs (last 500 lines)
  - Reports which doc files exist (CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md)
- **Worker log rotation** — Existing log rotated to `<name>-timestamp.log` on spawn
  - Current session always writes to fresh `<name>.log`
- **Push button** in Activity panel's Unpushed section

Workers no longer need to update docs — this is handled at push time.

---

### Diff Preview + Raw Keys + Unpushed Tracking

- **Diff preview** — Click changed files in Activity panel to see git diff in a new tab
  - `DiffPreview.jsx` — Syntax-colored diff viewer (green additions, red deletions)
  - `GET /api/diff?project=&path=` — Returns git diff for specific file
  - Handles untracked files (shows full content as additions)
- **Raw key sending** — Escape/Enter buttons now work properly in tmux
  - `raw` parameter in `send_keys()` sends as tmux key vs literal text
  - Escape button styled red, Plan button styled blue
- **Plan button** — Sends `/plan` to active worker's Claude Code session
- **Unpushed commits section** — Activity panel shows commits ahead of origin
  - `get_unpushed_commits()` — Gets commits via `git log upstream..HEAD`
  - Blue badge shows total count across projects
  - Shows commit hash + message for each
- **Worker logging** — Output saved to `~/orchestrator/logs/workers/<name>.log`
  - 50k line scrollback buffer per worker
- **Git status normalization** — Consistent M/U/A/D indicators

---

### VSCode-Style Features

- **Auto-discover projects** — Scans for directories with CLAUDE.md files instead of manual registry
  - `discover_projects()` recursively finds projects up to depth 3
  - Shows `~/*.md` files (SOUL.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, WORKER.md) at root
  - Projects appear as collapsible folders below
- **Git status indicators** — Files show status badges:
  - `M` (yellow) = modified
  - `U` (green) = untracked
  - `A` (green) = added
  - `D` (red) = deleted
  - Folders show yellow dot if children have changes
- **File preview with syntax highlighting**:
  - `FilePreview.jsx` — Uses highlight.js for Python, JS, JSON, YAML, Markdown, CSS, HTML, Bash
  - Line numbers display
  - `GET /api/file?path=` — Returns file content with language detection
- **Tab-based navigation**:
  - `TabBar.jsx` — Tabs for terminals and file previews
  - Worker terminals open as new tabs (not replacing partner)
  - Partner terminal tab cannot be closed
  - File tabs closable with × button
- **Folders collapsed by default** — Cleaner initial view
- **Unified file tree** — `GET /api/home` returns combined tree with git status

---

### Made Orchestrator Shareable

- **Created setup/start/stop scripts** for easy installation:
  - `setup.sh` — Checks dependencies, installs Python/Node packages
  - `start.sh` — Launches API, web server, and tmux session
  - `stop.sh` — Clean shutdown of all processes
- **Created README.md** — Quick start guide with requirements
- **Created example files**:
  - `state/projects.example.yaml` — Template for user configuration
  - `docs/SOUL.example.md` — Example working style document
- **Updated .gitignore** — Properly ignores user config, logs, proposals

Fresh clone now works in 5 minutes:
```bash
git clone <repo> && cd orchestrator
./setup.sh
cp state/projects.example.yaml state/projects.yaml
./start.sh
```

---

### UI Redesign: 3-Column Layout

- **New layout structure**:
  - Left: FileTree with project dropdown + recursive file explorer
  - Center: Single terminal for selected worker (removed duplicate)
  - Right: WorkerList + Activity panel
  - Bottom: QuickActions + input bar
- **New API endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/projects` — List from projects.yaml
  - `GET /api/files/<project>` — Recursive file tree (max depth 4)
  - `GET /api/changes` — Git status across all projects
  - `GET /api/activity` — Combined pending/changes/recent feed
- **New components**:
  - `FileTree.jsx` — Project dropdown + expandable file tree
  - `WorkerList.jsx` — Simplified worker list
  - `Activity.jsx` — Pending proposals, git changes, recent activity
- **Deleted redundant components**:
  - `ChatArea.jsx` — Had duplicate partner terminal
  - `ProcessTree.jsx` — Replaced by simpler WorkerList
- **Bug fix**: Git status parsing (`strip().split()` was corrupting first line)

---

### Resizable Panels + Quick Actions

- **All panels now resizable**: proposals section, process tree, sidebar
- **QuickActions component**: 1, 2, 3, 4, Y, N, Enter, Esc buttons
- **Quick actions on both** partner terminal and worker terminal
- **Input field** for sending text to selected worker

### Worker Proposal Testing Session

- **Verified WORKER.md implementation** — workers can submit proposals via curl
- **Tested full proposal lifecycle**:
  - Submit proposal → pending status
  - List via `orch proposals`
  - Approve via `orch approve` → approved status
  - Reject via UI → rejected status
- **Coordinated worker shutdown**:
  - Sent end-of-session tasks to both workers
  - Workers updated CHANGELOG, TODO, ran usage reports
  - Workers committed and pushed before shutdown
  - Killed workers cleanly after receiving "DONE"

---

### Rename Plans to Proposals + WORKER.md

- **Renamed "plan" to "proposal"** — Avoids confusion with Claude Code's built-in plan mode
  - `state/plans/` → `state/proposals/`
  - `/api/plans` → `/api/proposals`
  - `PlanCard.jsx` → `ProposalCard.jsx`
  - `orch plan` → `orch propose`
- **Created `~/WORKER.md`** — Instructions for workers on how to submit proposals
  - Workers curl to `POST /api/proposals` with id, title, worker, steps
  - Workers can verify proposals via `GET /api/proposals`
  - Documents end-of-session cleanup tasks
- **UI improvements**:
  - Collapsible proposals section with pending count badge
  - Delete button (×) for completed proposals
  - Resizable sidebar (200-600px) with draggable divider
  - Compact ProcessTree styling
  - Better spacing and proportions

---

### Partner Orchestration + SOUL Integration
